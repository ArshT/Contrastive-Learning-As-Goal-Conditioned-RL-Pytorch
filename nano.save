- Using `nano`:
  ```bash
  nano ~/.bashrc
  ```

- Using `vim`:
  ```bash
  vim ~/.bashrc
  ```

### Step 2: Add the Desired Line

Once the file is open, scroll to the bottom and add the line you want. For example, if you're adding a new environment variable or alias:

```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="my_value"
```

Or adding a new alias:

```baswwwwwwwdasdh
asdqasdlias ll='ls -la'
```

### Step 3: Save and Exit

- If you’re using `nano`, press `CTRL + O` to save and `CTRL + X` to exit.
- If you’re using `vim`, press `ESC`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.

### Step 4: Apply the Changes

To apply the changes made to `.bashrc` without restarting your terminal, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
nano ~/.bashrc
c
Now the line you added should take effect immediately.
